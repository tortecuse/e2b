What is the Insanity Workout?
 
The Insanity Workout is a 60-day program that consists of 14 different workouts that are designed to challenge your body and mind. The workouts are based on the principle of max interval training, which means you perform high-intensity exercises for short periods of time, followed by brief rest periods. This way, you can burn more calories and fat, increase your metabolism, and improve your cardiovascular and muscular endurance.
 
The workouts are divided into two phases: the first month and the second month. The first month includes five workouts that last about 40 minutes each: Fit Test, Plyometric Cardio Circuit, Cardio Power & Resistance, Cardio Recovery, and Pure Cardio. The second month includes four workouts that last about an hour each: Max Interval Circuit, Max Interval Plyo, Max Cardio Conditioning, and Max Recovery. There are also two bonus workouts that you can do anytime: Cardio Abs and Core Cardio & Balance.
 
The Insanity Workout also comes with a nutrition guide that provides you with a meal plan and recipes that can help you fuel your body and achieve your goals. The nutrition guide is based on the principle of eating five small meals a day, consisting of lean protein, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and fruits and vegetables. The guide also gives you tips on how to stay hydrated, avoid cravings, and adjust your calories according to your needs.
 
The Insanity Workout is suitable for anyone who wants to challenge themselves and get in the best shape of their lives. However, it is not recommended for beginners or people with health issues or injuries. The workouts are very intense and require a lot of stamina, strength, and flexibility. You should consult your doctor before starting the program and follow the safety instructions provided by the trainer.
