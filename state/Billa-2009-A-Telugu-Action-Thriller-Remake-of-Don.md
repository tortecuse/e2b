The film revolves around Billa, an underworld don who operates from Malaysia and is wanted by Interpol. ACP Krishnamoorthy, who has been tracking Billa for years, finally manages to kill him in an accident. However, he keeps his death a secret and recruits Ranga, a petty thief from Visakhapatnam who looks exactly like Billa, to infiltrate Billa's gang and provide information to the police. Ranga pretends to have lost his memory and slowly gains the trust of Billa's associates, including Maya, a female member who wants to avenge her brother's death by Billa. However, things get complicated when Lisa, Billa's girlfriend, discovers Ranga's true identity and tries to kill him. Ranga accidentally kills Lisa and escapes from the police. He also finds out that ACP Krishnamoorthy has been killed by someone from Billa's gang. Ranga then decides to expose the real mastermind behind Billa's network and clear his name.

Billa 2009 was one of the most anticipated films of the year, as it marked the first collaboration between Prabhas and Meher Ramesh, who had previously worked as an assistant director for several Telugu blockbusters. The film was also a tribute to Krishnam Raju, who played the original Billa in Yugandhar and also appeared as ACP Krishnamoorthy in this film. The film's music was composed by Mani Sharma, who had earlier scored for Prabhas's films like Varsham and Chatrapathi. The film's soundtrack album was released on 21 March 2009 and received positive reviews from critics and audiences. The film's songs like "Bommali", "My Name is Billa", and "Ellora Shilpanni" became chartbusters and were widely popular among the youth.
 
The film was made on a budget of â¹18 crore and was released on 3 April 2009 in around 500 screens worldwide. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics, who praised Prabhas's performance, action sequences, cinematography, and music, but criticized the film's weak screenplay, direction, editing, and lack of originality. The film was also compared unfavorably to the Tamil version of Billa (2007), which starred Ajith Kumar and Nayanthara in the lead roles. Some critics also felt that the film did not do justice to the original Don (1978), which starred Amitabh Bachchan and Zeenat Aman.
 
The film was a moderate success at the box office, earning around â¹26 crore in its lifetime run. The film performed well in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, but failed to impress the audiences in other states and overseas markets. The film was also affected by the release of other big-budget films like Arundhati, Kick, Magadheera, and Eega in the same year. The film was later dubbed into Hindi as The Return of Rebel 2 in 2017 and was telecast on several television channels.
